# Systems Biology
Systems Biology Final project is a project purposed on replication of the results shown in the article named *'Deep learning decodes the principles of differential gene expression'* by *Shinya Tasaki*. 

This repository contains two files named **Correlation_Plot(GTEx).ipynb** and **Correlation_Plot(HPA).ipynb**

The first file, Correlation_Plot(GTEx).ipynb, is a python code which visualizes the correlation plot between the DeepLIFT score and the gene's binding site expression levels by using the data from the **GTEx dataset**; GTEx is the dataset used by the research article. 

The second file, Correlation_Plot(HPA).ipynb, is a python code which visualizes the correlation plot between the DeepLIFT score and the gene's binding site expression levels by using the data from the **HPA(Human Protein Atlas)**; HPA dataset is the dataset we used to see if we could replicate similar results obtained from using the GTEx dataset.
