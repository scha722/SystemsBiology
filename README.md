# Systems Biology
Systems Biology Final project is a project purposed on replication of the results shown in the article named 'Deep learning decodes the principles of differential gene expression' by Shinya Tasaki
This repository contains two files named SystemsBiology.ipynb and SystemsBiology2.ipynb
the first file, SystemsBiology.ipynb, is a python code which visualizes the correlation plot between the DeepLIFT score and the gene's binding site expression levels by using the data from the GTEx dataset; GTEx is the dataset used by the research article. 
the second file, SystemsBiology2.ipynb, is a python code which visualizes the correlation plot between the DeepLIFT score and the gene's binding site expression levels by using the data from the HPA(Human Protein Atlas) datset; HPA dataset is the dataset we used to see if we could replicate similar results obtained from using the GTEx dataset.
